## üíª Project Abstract
In modern medicine, polypharmacy (using multiple medications) increases the risk of adverse **drug interactions**. This project develops an **AI-driven system** that predicts **drug interactions** and **side effects** using **deep learning models** trained on large-scale medical **datasets**. By leveraging **MLOps** best practices, the system ensures streamlined integration and continuous deployment. The project also incorporates **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to accurately extract drug names from clinical texts and employs **Natural Language Processing** techniques to enhance prediction accuracy paving the way for innovative solutions in **Healthcare AI**.

### *Key Features*
- **Drug Interaction Prediction**: Predict adverse reactions between multiple drugs.
- **Side Effect Analysis**: Identify potential symptoms and reactions.

The project will leverage **Python**, **PyTorch**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, and **cloud-based deployment** to create an effective AI system for healthcare professionals.

## ü´ß Background

### *Why This Project?*
With increasing prescription complexity, drug interactions can cause severe **side effects**, hospitalizations, or even fatalities. Existing tools often rely on **rule-based systems** that lack accuracy in real-world applications.

### *Challenges Addressed*
- **Large Dataset Complexity**: Extracting meaningful insights from **FAERS**, **Medline**, and **openFDA**.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Ensuring fast and accurate drug interaction predictions.
- **Healthcare Compliance**: Maintaining **HIPAA** standards and data privacy regulations.
- **Scalability**: Deploying an **AI-powered system** for large-scale use in hospitals and pharmacies.

By leveraging **deep learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, and retrieval-augmented generation, this project aims to provide accurate and explainable drug interaction predictions.

## üìã High-Level Requirements

### ‚úÖ Functional Requirements
The system will be capable of:
1. Predicting adverse drug interactions (ADIs) based on existing datasets.
2. Identifying potential side effects using **deep learning** models.
3. Retrieving external medical knowledge (e.g., **Medline**, **FAERS**, **openFDA**).
4. Supporting **cloud-based deployment** for real-world integration.
