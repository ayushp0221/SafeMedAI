## üíª Project Abstract:  
<P>In modern medicine, *polypharmacy* (using multiple medications) increases the risk of adverse drug interactions. This project develops an *AI-driven system* that predicts *drug interactions* and *side effects* using *deep learning models trained on large-scale medical datasets*.</P>

### *Key Features*:
- *Drug Interaction Prediction*: Predict adverse reactions between multiple drugs.
- *Side Effect Analysis*: Identify potential symptoms and reactions.

The project will leverage *Python, PyTorch, NLP techniques, and cloud-based deployment* to create an effective AI system for healthcare professionals.

### ü´ß Background
### *Why this project?*
With increasing prescription complexity, drug interactions can cause severe *side effects, hospitalizations, or even fatalities. Existing tools often rely on **rule-based systems* that *lack accuracy* in real-world applications.

### *Challenges Addressed*
- *Large dataset complexity: Extracting meaningful insights from **FAERS, Medline, and openFDA*.
- *Real-time inference: Ensuring **fast and accurate* drug interaction predictions.
- *Healthcare compliance: Maintaining **HIPAA* and *data privacy* regulations.
- *Scalability: Deploying an **AI-powered system* for large-scale use in hospitals and pharmacies.

By leveraging *deep learning, NLP, and retrieval-augmented generation, this project aims to provide **accurate and explainable* drug interaction predictions.

## üìã *High-Level Requirements*
### ‚úÖ *Functional Requirements*
The system will be capable of:
1. Predicting *adverse drug interactions (ADIs)* based on existing datasets.
2. Identifying *potential side effects* using deep learning models.
3. Retrieving *external medical knowledge* (Medline, FAERS, openFDA).
4. Supporting *cloud-based deployment* for real-world integration.
